# Buyables

Buyables are usually things that can be bought multiple times with scaling costs. If you set a respec function,
the player can reset the purchases to get their currency back.

The amount of a buyable owned is a Decimal.
You can get or set the amount of a buyable with getBuyableAmt(layer, id) and setBuyableAmt(layer, id, amt).
You can use buyableEffect(layer, id) to get the current effects of a buyable.

Buyables should be formatted like this:

```js
    buyables: {
        rows: # of rows
        cols: # of columns
        respec() {}, **optional**, implement it to reset things and give back your currency.
                     Having this function makes a respec button appear
        respecText: **optional**, text that appears on the respec button
        11: {
            display() {return "Blah"},
            etc
        }
        etc
    }
```

Features:

- title: **optional**, displayed at the top in a larger font
         It can also be a function that returns updating text.

- cost(): cost for buying the next buyable. Can have an optional argument "x" to calculate the cost of the x+1th object,
          but needs to use "current amount" as a default value for x. (x is a Decimal).
          Can return an object if there are multiple currencies.
                    
- effect(): **optional**, A function that calculates and returns the current values of bonuses
            of this buyable. Can return a value or an object containing multiple values.

- display(): A function returning everything that should be displayed on the buyable after the title, likely
           including the description, amount bought, cost, and current effect. Can use basic HTML.

- unlocked(): **optional**, A function returning a bool to determine if the buyable is visible or not. Default is unlocked.

- canAfford(): A function returning a bool to determine if you can buy one of the buyables.

- buy(): A function that implements buying one of the buyable, including spending the currency.

- buyMax(): **optional**, A function that implements buying as many of the buyable as possible.

- style: **Optional**, Applies CSS to this buyable, in the form of an object where the keys are CSS attributes,
         and the values are the values for those attributes (both as strings)
         
- layer: **Assigned automagically**. It's the same value as the name of this layer, so you can do player[this.layer].points or similar

- id: **Assigned automagically**. It's the "key" which the buyable was stored under, for convenient access.
      The buyable in the example's id is 11.
