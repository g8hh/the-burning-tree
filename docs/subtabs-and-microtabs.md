# Subtabs and Microtabs

Subtabs are separate sections of a tab that you can view by selecting one at the top of the tab. Microtabs are smaller areas that function in much the same way.

Subtabs are defined by using the tab format like this, where each element of tabFormat is given the name of that subtab:

```js
    tabFormat: {
        "Main tab": {
            *subtab features*
        },
        "Other tab": {
            *subtab features*
        },

        etc
    },
```

Microtabs are defined similarly, and use the same features, but are defined in the "microtabs" feature. Each entry is a 
group of tabs which will appear in a microtabs component. The first set, "stuff", has 2 tabs, and the second, 
"otherStuff", has none.

```js
    microtabs: {
        stuff: {
            first: {
            *subtab features*
            },
            second: {
            *subtab features*
            },
        },

        otherStuff: {
            // There could be another set of microtabs here
        }
    },
```

Normal subtabs and microtab subtabs both use the same features:

# Features:

- content: The tab layout code for the subtab, in [the tab layout format](custom-tab-layouts.md)

- style: **Optional**, A CSS object or function returning a CSS object, which affects the CSS when in that subtab.

- buttonStyle: **Optional**, A CSS object or function returning that CSS object, which affects the appearance of the button for that subtab.

- unl(): **Optional**, a function to determine if the button for this subtab should be visible. By default, a subtab is always unlocked. 
    (You can't use the "this" keyword in this function.)
